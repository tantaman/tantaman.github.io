# Investor Meeting Response

*shifts uncomfortably, then leans back with forced confidence*

Okay, okay - fair points. You're right about infrastructure, I was thinking too surface-level. But listen...

**Background:** I've been at Meta for 3 years, worked on Llama inference optimization and built internal tools for ML model deployment. Shipped the distributed training pipeline that's handling 40% of our current AI workloads. Not just another PM with a deck.

**On governance/compliance:** YES. This is exactly what I've been prototyping internally. Meta's spending $2M/month just on audit compliance for our AI decision systems. I've seen the pain firsthand - legal teams manually reviewing AI outputs, compliance officers trying to trace model decisions through 500 layers. 

The middleware angle is spot-on too. I'm actually working on something that sits between the model and application layer. Think of it as a "performance broker" - routes requests to the optimal model/instance combo based on latency, cost, and accuracy requirements. Real-time A/B testing but for model performance.

**What I'm building:** A service that guarantees 99.5% uptime and sub-100ms latency for AI inference while cutting costs 40% through intelligent routing and caching. Already tested it on Meta's customer service bot traffic.

*pulls up phone showing metrics*

Here's the thing - I know I sound like every other SF tech bro with a "revolutionary AI startup." But I've got 6 months of production data and 3 potential enterprise customers already interested based on the internal demo.

What would you need to see to take this seriously?

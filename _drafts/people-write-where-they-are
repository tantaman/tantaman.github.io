I was sticking all my notes into Github issues.

I started this blog again.

Now I'm sticking all my notes into the draft section of this blog.

Github issue pros:
- authoring UI
- tagging?
- comments? maybe?

These docs pros:
- quick and easy to create
- quick and easy to edit
- unstructured

Docs negatives:
- No tags
- No UI to browse by tag
- Hard to link against one another
- Hard to visualize links (or impossible?)

Negs for both:
- No hierarchy

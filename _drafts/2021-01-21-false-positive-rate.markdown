Follow ups (on original post in posts):
- Prevalence here is really "prior probability"
- We were denied tests due to unknown prior probability and capacity for blanket testing to incur a false pandemic
- Case number reporting
  - Still no good (due to unk prevalence)
  - We should have % positive of population tested
    - removes false positive rate concerns
    - but of course the population tested is self-selecting and has a higher prior probability of infection
    - So what's the actual prevalence among the population at large?
- Deaths... deaths and hospitalizations w/ covid we can be more confident about due to
  higher prior probability of having covid

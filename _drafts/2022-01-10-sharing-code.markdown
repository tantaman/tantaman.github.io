[//]: # 'Follow up on Improving Code Sharing with Yarn Workspaces'

The merits of the monorepo.

The drawbacks of versioned dependendencies and artifacts / non trunk based development.

This incidental complexities of branching.

The upsides of trunk based dev.

- Every commit must work
- Everything is deployed at once together
- Always integrating and upgrading. Incremental rather than ingesting tons of changes at once.

Branching creates artificial complexity.
Versioned artifacts do too. Now I have package management concerns rather than just push and pull concerns.

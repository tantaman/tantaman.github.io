If I want other people to be able to consume my notes, I can't have a cloud of tags where I end up with one piece per tag.

E.g., my new tagging of my blog articles only relies on a few tags.

Tags are just meant to split into chunks that are small enough to have the titles of the contents reviewed manually.
So probably 50 things per tag?

If we could do "sub-tags" that don't actually sub-divide the space under a tag until the user requests that space to be sub-divided.

We can build amazing technology (rockets, satellites, computers, cables, ships, subs, cars, etc.) but we're completely at a loss for understanding anything that must interact with living things.

Pharmacuticals and the medical field are a joke.

Over and over again we find out we're dispensing drugs that deform and destroy human beings.

When removing deaths of those under 5 years old, life expectancy hasn't changed since the days of ancienct Greece.

In effect, do our medications really do anything? Is the consequence of them just the creation of stronger bacteria that require more antibiotics and doesn't improve our lot?
Is the medical system keeping alive all the carriers of genes that should be washed out by natural death? And those carriers then live on to birth more people with more problems.
Effectively creating a more sickly and difficult to sustain population over time. It would explain why life expectancy has not increased but medical interventions and procedures have.

If life expectancy does increase, what's the value of 6 more years anyway? 6 more years at the upper end of 70.

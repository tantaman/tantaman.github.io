All living things innately know how to live in their environment.

Plants are adapted perfectly to where they grow. This fact becomes tremendously apparent whenver you try to take care of a plant in your house. Likely you end up killing many many plants before you succeed to keeping them alive even though these plants thrive outdoors. A plants needs for nourishment exactly matches what is probvided by the location in which they are naturally found. Indoors we must try to replicate that environment and any slight deviation kills the plant.

Animals are also adapted to their environment. They know what to eat, where to get it, how to hunt or gather it.

Why, then, do we not think that the human body has this wisdom? If you spend time listening to your body and purging false influences, you realize that it the body craves the food that is best for it, craves activity when it has been lethargic and craves variety when there has been too much of the same.

How did humanity figure out what plants to eat and how to prepare them at the beginning of time? It couldn't have purely been trial and error. And discoveries of medicinal plants... (the fertility drug of the greeks)

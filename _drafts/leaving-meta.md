Why I left work...

-> Changing of the world and company. No more delights and curls.
-> from CIB to... something else.
-> Privacy... Not at a stage of maturity that allows principled decision making. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casuistry
-> Oliver, need to do my own thinking and things

Why write?

-> Is it waste of time or brings more clarity to what you're doing so you can do less / be more effective?
The hardest part is figuring out what you're building.. but still need pages of pages of calculation for the "in the dirt" work and intuition.

The trend of western history: Self aggrandizement and correction thereof.

Everything orbits the earth.
Nope, we orbit the sun.

We're in the center of the universe.
Nope, we're who knows where.

We were divinly created.
Nope, likely we descended over time from other species.
("likely" here because this view is not definitevly proven due to the giant gap between us and our closest ancestor. There's room to argue that we were designed.)

We will live forever.
Unlikely. There's no evidence to support any sort of notion of life after death.

^-- kinda weak argument for the trend.

(see arguments from science)

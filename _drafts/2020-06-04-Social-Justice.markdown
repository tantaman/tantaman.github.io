What can I do to help with the current inequalities?

# Bail Reform

> Bail - property or money given as surety that a person released from custody will return at an appointed time.

When looking at cases like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalief_Browder#:~:text=Kalief%20Browder%20(May%2025%2C%201993,for%20two%20of%20these%20years. the amount of money set for bail seems arbitrary.

The tldr of the above is that a young man was held in prison for 3 years without ever having a trial. He was stuck in prison because his family could not affort to post bail.

Bail is insurance. Insurance that the person who paid it will return to custody in order to get their money back.

Bail needs to take into account the ability of the person to pay it. If we believe that individuals should be able to be released from custody prior to trial and that everyone is equal in the eyes of the law, then why should that barrier be easy to pass for wealthy individuals and hard to pass for poor individuals? It should be just as difficult for both. Bail should be a percentage of yearly income so it puts equal pressure on the rich and poor alike.


# Removing Mandatory Sentences

The judicial systems hears cases and is supposed to consider crimes on a _case by case basis_.

Did you know that there are mandatory minimum sentences? In other words, if someone is convicted of a crime the judge must pass a given sentence rather than passing the sentence that is most appropriate under the given circumstances.

Blanket mandatory minimum sentences are the opposite of considering things on a case by case basis and the opposite of justice.

# Ending Crony Capitalism

It irks me whenever people call for "the end of capitalism." We've never actually had capitalism in the United States. The ills of economic inequality largely come from government involvement in the markets.

Examples:
1. Nick Leche promoting legalization of weed. only 10 companies allowed.
2. Veritcal integation required in FL
3. Licenses
4. Redlining by gov't housing organizations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%20and,the%20selective%20raising%20of%20prices.

The problems of the market arise when the market is strictly in response to demand without moral considerations.

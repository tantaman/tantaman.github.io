On the themes of budget-architecture, budget-programming and "you aint gonna need it", the apps at TOOD-MVC really disappoint me.

Budget Architecture:
Software on a budget. The minimalist architecture.
- Kafka bus for all logging needs
- Async / lambda
- Crypto service
- Smc service discovery, load balancing, fail over
- Twshared pool
- Real-time server for data subscriptions
- Deployments
- Deletion

Js shouldnâ€™t have added classes.

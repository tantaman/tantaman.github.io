Arguments from science.

Why are arguments from science ineffective?
Because they imply and rely on a trust of the scientific community. They do not rely on the scientific process but instead rely upon human beings consistent application of the scientific method over time.
That and correct interpretation of the results of the scientific method.

Science is plagued by incomplete information and unperceived (by the human being) factors that influence their experimentation.

I tell someone that science has proved that we are not at the center of the universe.

What does that mean to them? Based on a basic understanding of space they can rebut:
"Isn't space infinite? Thus it has no center"
"Have we observed to the end of the universe in all directions?"
"How do we know we've observed to the end in all directions?"
"Isn't the size of the known universe always expanding as older and older light arrives?"

I tell someone that science has shown that we have evolved from apes and not been divinely created.

I tell someone that race does not exist.

I tell someone that global warming is a thing.

Science has been placed on untrusted footing due to current politics.
The scientific and medial community has many times said that masks are ineffective at preventing the spread of COVID-19. Wtf? That just flies in the face of common sense.
How would barriers, barriers that visibly stifle and stop sneezes, not slow the spread of a virus? Especially when healthy and sick are both wearing them.

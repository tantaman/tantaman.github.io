Can't fight racism with race based policies.

White, south, only know white.
Think everyone is starting at the same baseline.

Race based diversity policies thus look like discrimination or holding poor white ppl down.

Policies should have been based on economics of the siutation as those economically disadvantaged are also those of a disadvantaged race.

Everyone can get behind the rags to riches story.

Poor white ppl wouldn't feel left behind -- they're included in the aid.

Trump's base was fueled by this feeling of unfairness. Especially when Hillary was running a rallying cry was "its time" -- time for a woman president? just b/c she's a woman? that 
isn't based on merit at all and is another example of seeming discrimination.

The biggest lie in investing is that volatiliy = risk.

This is bogus. It misses the point of risk. Risk is about the chances of losing your money in an investment. Volatility does not capture that whatsoever. What does it matter if the price of an investment swings wildly up and down so long as the mean of those swings always trends upwards?

# Examples

The first graph is a highly volatile investment but the trend of the volatility is always upwards. If we've done our own risk assessment then this sort of upwards volatility doesn't matter to us.

The second example has very low volatility and so, by traditional anylsis, is considered "low risk." The price plummets at the end, however, because there was a risk in the underlying security that volatility couldn't account for.

# You're just drawing shit!

Yeah, I'm just drawing shit but the underlying principle holds. Lets pull data on real world companies that capture the reasoning above.





# Where did Risk = Volatility come from?

So where did the idea of volatility = risk come from?

In what cases is volatility most closely aligned with risk?

An investment is risky only if there is a good chance of losing your investment.

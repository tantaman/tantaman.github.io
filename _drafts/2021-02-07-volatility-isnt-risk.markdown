The biggest lie in investing is that volatiliy = risk.

This is bogus. It misses the point of risk. Risk is about the chances of losing your money in an investment. Volatility does not capture that whatsoever. What does it matter if the price of an investment swings wildly up and down, so long as the mean of those swings always trends upwards?

# Examples

The first graph is a highly volatile investment but the trend of the volatility is always upwards. If we've done our own risk assessment then this sort of upwards volatility doesn't matter to us.

The second example has very low volatility and so, by traditional anylsis, is considered "low risk." The price plummets at the end, however, because there was a risk in the underlying security that volatility couldn't account for.

# You're just drawing shit!

Yeah, I'm just drawing shit but the underlying principle holds. Volatility of an investment doesn't capture real world risk and doesn't matter if the overall trend is upwards. To drive this point home, lets look at Carnival Cruise's and Facebook's stocks. Carnival is a low volatility stock so by traditional analysis it would have been considered a safe bet. However, if you invested in Carnival anytime in the last 20 years you would have lost all of your money due to the coronavirus pandemic and its unclear when, if ever, you'll get it back. Carnival could go bankrupt before the pandemic is over.

When investing you often hear "past performance does not guarantee future performance." Well volatility is a measure of past price swings. If we don't think past performance guarantees future performance, why do we think past price swings guarantee future price swings and risk?

On the flip side we have Facebook. Facebook has been a volatile stock and, by proxy, considered risky.

# You're just choosing arbitrary cutoffs

One could argue that Facebook would look just like Carnival if we chose to cut the FB graph off at 2019. Goes up the drops massively.

All of this goes to show that you can't asses risk by analyzing historical trends (such as volatility) in the price of the asset.

# Assessing Risk

So how do you assess risk? Risk is a subjective measure and is based on what you know about the company you are investing in.

1. Does the company solve a real world problem?
2. Does the company have a growing market?
3. There will always be future crises. Has the company adapted well in the past?
4. What threats exist to the company's business model, what's the impact of those threats, and how likely are they to come to pass? Examples:
   1. Regulatory
   2. Environmental
   3. Competitive
   4. Cultural
   5. Technical
5. How hyped is the company and has that hype translated into buying, driving up the price?

**Said by a parent**
> "You're having a kid? Your life is over."

Said in _jest_? Said in _seriousness_? Idk. If it is said in seriousness then it is said by one who doesn't understand life.

That statement doesn't understand the transitions of life.

Life's not over, just different.

Was life over when entering school?
* When graduating?
* When going to college?
* When entering the workforce?
* When moving to a new place?

No. It was just new and different.

**Why is life often considered over when getting married or having a child?**

All of the prior transitions involve an accountability to oneself. All of the latter transitions add accountability to another.

Is life over because the other can check your desires? The other needs to be compromised with?

Object oriented design is bad software design.

It is user and org focused rather than problem and activity focused.

The org changes.
The activities don't.

What is the user trying to do.
Not what do they want, what do they currently use or what are they.

The action being taken is the essence of the thing.

The nouns being used to take those actions just so happen to be what exists now to enable the action. They're incidental to the problem.

Structural types will save us by allowing each user of a thing to specify what of the thing they want based on their context.
I take a user, but I give out movie times. I really only take the user's zip.
I take a user but I hold reservations. I need user name and phone.
I take a user and bill them. I need user name, id, address, payment info.

Each "user type" is different in each context. Structural types get that and allow information to be added or elided.

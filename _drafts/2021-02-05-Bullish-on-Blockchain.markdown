# Disclaimers & Bias
* I got into Crypto/Blockhain in Nov. 2020. A comparatively low point to now.
* The market is too hot for me right now to add more money. I feel that it needs to cool but will continue to re-asses.

# Resurgence
Cypto currencies are having another resurgence. Over the last year the two most popular coins are way way up.
* **Ether** is up `742%`
* **Bitcoin** is up `300%`.
* Compare that to the **S&P** which is only up `16%`, despite a record breaking year for the stock market.

**But haven't we been here before?** Like in 2018 when all the crypto currencies spiked to new highs and quickly thereafter all crashed?

Yes, yes we have. Some good news / bad news though:
1. The crash recovered
2. We're at, or near, new all-time highs now
3. The current rally is vastly different than 2018

(1) is good news in that there is staying power to these assets.<br/>
(2) is bad news since it induces hype and speculative buying.<br/>
(3) is what is important and why I have a bullish outlook for the future of Blockchain.

To understand (3) we need to know how 2021 is different than 2018.

But before we go there, lets take a step back. For any investment to be a _good_ **long term investment** it needs to be providing **some sort of value** by solving **real world problems.**

If you buy anything without knowing that it provides value and what problems it is solving then you're just gambling.

# Problems Being Solved

Similar to how your bank keeps a ledger of debits and credits to your account, blockchain technologies provide a `public`, `decentralized` and `immutable` ledger.
* Public means anyone can view it.
* Decentralized means no one entity controls it, making it very nearly impossible to write false records. I.e., it is corruption resistant.
* Immutable means once a record is recorded it can never be removed.

## Problem - Theft

Taken together, all of the properties of blockchain prevent theft and fraud.
1. Your government can't seize your assets.
2. False transactions cannot be attributed to you.
3. History can't be erased so entities can't lie or hide their transactions.
4. Ownership of an asset can be looked up by anyone.

## Problem - Lending

How do individuals lend to individuals today? It's really hard. You have to either lend through an institution or lend directly to someone you trust.

Through blockchain enabled smart contracts, peer to peer lending is easy and viable. Its almost as simple as me sticking money in a box outside my house, allowing people to borrow it and being guaranteed that they'll put up collateral or pay me back with interest.

## Problem - Contracts

## Problem - Asset Transfer

NFTs

## Problems - Fees

If you've bought a home you know how incredibly painful and expensive it is -- in terms of fees. Origination fees, processing fees, credit report fee, underwriting fee, title insurance, etc. etc.

You can easily end up paying between 5% of the loan amount. For a million dollar home you're spending 50k on fees.

Blockchain, along withs its smart contracts and non fungible tokens (NFTs) allows for the seamless miniscule-fee transfer of assets from one part to another once a set of conditions has been met.

1. Theft
2. Fees
3. Lending
4. Asset transactions
5. Smart contracts

# What's Changed?

A lot has changed that makes this time around something that will stick (although there are still risks that could bring it all down -- to be covered further on).

1. Bitcoin is powering human rights

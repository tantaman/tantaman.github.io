When we describe how we're feeling we say "I am angry", "I am upset", "I am X"

But you aren't _angry_ nor _upset_. You are feeling angry or upset. Describing emotions the way we currently do is incorrect in that it equates and identifies our state of being with those emotions. You aren't those emotions. You're experiencing those emotions.

You aren't angry, you're experiencing anger.

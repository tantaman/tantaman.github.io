After ~8 years working at Meta and ~15 years professionally programming post college (there were internships, freelancing, part-time programming employment and open source contributions as early as high school) I'm departing the workforce to puruse my own ideas full time.

# Vision

Create software to help people think more deeply.

# Strategy

Two prongs:

1. Develop note taking applications to allow individuals to capture, structure and develop their thoughts. Notes are not strictly text.
2. Uplevel programming languages by extricating them from incidental details.

# Why two prongs?

To converge organic knowledge capture with formal methods of encoding throught processes.

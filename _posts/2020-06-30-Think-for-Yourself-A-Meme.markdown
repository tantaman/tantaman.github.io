"Think for yourself" is being used as a motto by unthinking individuals.

It is an amazing example of the fragility and blindness of the human mind.

"Think for yourself" -- Anti-Masker
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Take your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#coronavirus</a> mask &amp; stick it where the sun donâ€™t shine. <a href="https://t.co/iJt4cNidlj">pic.twitter.com/iJt4cNidlj</a></p>&mdash; Aubrey Huff (@aubrey_huff) <a href="https://twitter.com/aubrey_huff/status/1273018665391099904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In the two prior examples, "Think for yourself" is used as an emotional response and a way to end discussion without further thought.

In the video above --

* The argument is that masking is living in fear?
  * That would assume you know how everyone wearing a mask feels. That they aren't doing it out of respect for others. That they aren't doing it with a sense of joyous duty of protecting their fellow man.
* The argument is that high risk individuals should all stay home?
  * That's assuming they _can_ all stay home. That they don't ever have to go out do things like acquire food. It's also assuming they have no right to a normal life. That imprisoning them in home is more valulable than inconveniencing ourselves for a few minutes a day with a mask while we're indoors in public places.
* The argument is that people are sad because they're in masks?
  * I guess the two people he saw. Are two checkout ladies are definitely a representative sample of the world?
* The argument is that we're breathing in CO2?
  * Have you gotten light headed from wearing a mask? All of the people that have worn masks on the job prior to coronavirus (doctors, construction workers while doing things such as insulating or painting), have they complained of CO2 poisoning?

Why do we go into tirades rather than engaging eachother in understanding?

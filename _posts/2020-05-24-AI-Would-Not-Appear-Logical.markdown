It always annoyed me growing up how people would assume that a machine would behave logically. Or that you could tell the thinking of a machine because it would look logical. E.g., in the matrix where they say "sounds like the thinking of a machine to me" or the thinking that humanity would be better than machines because we would have creativity and they would not.

Even if an actor is 100% perfectly logical their actions are very likely to often look illogical to an external observer. This is due to the fact that no entity is ever acting with complete information. They're only acting 
with the information that is available to them. In the face of incomplete information a "logical action" can look completely pathological when considered within the context of all the information or a different set of information.

Today we microwave food in plastics, tomorrow we find out that that releases harmful chemicals into our food.
Right now I grab a giant bowl for ceral, the next minute I realize we have only a small bowl's worth of cereal left.

There is a mirror to this in creativity. People often say "how creative that person is" or "how were they able to think of that?" -- the person they're speaking of is operating in a different world of information and one in which their "creative" ideas are actually run of the mill and very common.

I notice this in my own life as there are a great deal of things I am much better at than those around me. To me those things seem simple and trivial and for years I never understood why everyone else couldn't do them as easily. They swim in a different sea of knowledge, information and experiences. One in which these things do not come easily or are lacking entirely.

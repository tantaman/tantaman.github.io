In 2022 I left Meta to become a [MicroFounder](https://microfounder.com/).
<br/>The high level of what I'm working on is beginning to take shape here: [Vision]({% post_url 2021-12-27-Personal-Vision %})

### Hi there üëã

Here is a taste of what I like to work on and think about as it relates to code.

# üî≠ Open Source

- Re-writing [Strut](https://github.com/tantaman/Strut) to be re-launched with a focus on rapid, non-linear presentation authoring and note taking.
- Working on [language and storage system agnostic](https://github.com/tantaman/aphrodite) schema definitions.
- Prototyping centralized logging and real-time detection systems

# ‚úçÔ∏è Currently Writing

- The lost half of domain modeling
- Why programming languages are tied up in incidental details
- Encoding the _why_ into programs
- Expressing policy and regulatory commitments using structural types
- Why string, bool, int, etc. are not types\*
- The need for nominal, structural, conceptual, computational and storage types
- Why invariants and assertions are a sign that your language, type system or design is lacking
- The merit behind the statement "OO Design is Bad Design"

# ü§î Currently Thinking About

- [How](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2021/03/05/bring-your-own-client.html) to [improve](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) software [interoperability](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-webs-missing-interoperability/)
- [Counterfactuals in ML](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/1541698967/ref=asc_df_1541698967/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459440273404&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6941749223415101727&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9007770&hvtargid=pla-917887947980&psc=1)
- [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) and their use in determining the [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance) of digital goods
- Personal and collaborative knowledge management
  - Improving the experience of document authoring and consumption
  - Un-siloing everything you've ever saved or written

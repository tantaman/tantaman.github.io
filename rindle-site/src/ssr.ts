// SSR preload — the server-side counterpart to the in-browser engine. On the first visit the route
// loader runs HERE (the server) and reads each first-paint query ONCE through the app authority
// (server/app-api.ts) — the SAME `createAppApi` factory the /api/rindle server route uses, called
// IN-PROCESS (no HTTP hop) because SSR and the API now share one server. The authority resolves
// `(name, args)` → AST itself; the loader never ships a raw AST. It returns the dehydrated snapshot
// for the HTML, `rindle.Provider` hydrates it for an instant correct first paint, then the wasm engine
// boots and the live `subscribe` reconciles.
//
// This is a STRICTLY server-side module: it builds the daemon client and reads `process.env`, so it is
// imported ONLY by the TanStack adapter's server-side preload callback (a dynamic import), keeping it
// out of the client bundle. It never imports the engine.

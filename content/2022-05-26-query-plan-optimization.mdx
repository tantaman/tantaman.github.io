This is the third part in a deep dive into [Aphrodite's](https://aphrodite.sh) query layer.

- [Part 1](./2022-05-26-query-builder) we talked about the query builder
- [Part 2](./2022-05-26-query-planning) covered query plans

Now we'll cover how we optimize query plans.

# Optimization? Wtf? ðŸ˜•

One of the first questions might be why an `ORM` needs to do query optimization. Isn't an `ORM` just translating the user's desired query to `SQL` (or other target backend query format)? And don't databases already do query optimization? Given that, why do we need an optimization layer in the `ORM`? Seems duplicative.

# Optimization Goals

To understand this better we need to clarify what we mean by optimization. `Aphrodite`'s optimization step has two goals in mind:

1. Generate as few database calls as possible
2. Minimze the amount of data returned from the database as much as possible

A really dumb ORM might issue a SQL query for every join and then join all the data in the application server. We really don't want to do this.

To accomplish our goals, `Aphrodite` does two things during optimization:

1. Collapses `HopPlans` into their source plans everywhere possible
2. Collapses derived expressions into source expressions everywhere possible

What those two steps accomplish is to "hoist" all of the operations expressed by the user to be run in the database. E.g., hoisting filters, limits, hop/joins, order bys, etc. to be encoded into the SQL statement (or other db statement) and run in the database.

`Aphrodite` also need optimization for a third reason. That is due to the fact that `Aphrodite` lets (will let) you declare edges between rows in different data sources (e.g., `SQL` to `Redis` to `ZippyDB` to `Neo4J`). These datasources are unaware that they're being wired together at a higher level and thus `Aphrodite` needs to take care of optimizing queries that span data stores. Cross data store query optimization is for a different post but some of the building blocks are [hinted at here](./2022-05-26-chunk-iterable).

Sorry to break the news but even when you figure out how to upload your consciousness to a computer, you'll still have a body.

The essence of a body, for a conscious thing, is that it is a **limiting** factor.

The body limits your perspective (what you can see at a given time) and your thinking (how much you can consider at once).

These limitations, while different, still exist in a digital realm. You must either bring your mind to the data you wish it to perceive (e.g., like walking in the real world) or bring the data to your mind (e.g., asking someone to bring something to you).

The body is an observer (e.g., camera), dropped into an environment, turning-rotating-seeking things to perceive and ruminate over.

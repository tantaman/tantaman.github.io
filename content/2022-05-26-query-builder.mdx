[Aphrodite](http://aphrodite.sh) generates rich and type safe query builders ([example](https://github.com/tantaman/aphrodite/blob/main/packages/integration-tests-ts/src/generated/UserQuery.ts#L17-L66)) from your schemas.
The query builders not only query for nodes of a given type but also traverse edges, apply filters, do pagination and more.

As an example, we can traverse from a user to their photos uploaded after `2022-01-01` to users tagged in those photos named `Jeff` like so:

```typescript
const jeffQuery = user
  .queryPhotos()
  .whereUploadDate(P.greaterThan(new Date('2022-01-01')))
  .queryTaggedUsers()
  .whereName(P.equals('Jeff'));
```

Given that each hop can return a new type of query (e.g., `PhotoQuery` or `UserQuery`) on which to apply filters or take more hops, how do we enable such an API?

The solution is pretty simple. Every invocation to a method on the query builder returns a new query builder that holds:

1. A reference the previous query
2. A reference to the expression (filter/map/limit/etc) being applied

I.e.,

```javascript
class UserQuery implements Query {
  sourceQuery: Query;
  expression: Expression | null;
  ...

  queryPhotos() {
    return new PhotoQuery(this);
  }

  whereName(predicate) {
    return new UserQuery(this, predicate)
  }
}
```

This forms a linked list which represents all the invocations made against the query builder, creating a structure that looks like:

<center>
  <Mermaid
    id="one"
    chart={`graph LR
UserQueryF["UserQuery(name == Jeff)"] --> UserQuery
UserQuery --> PhotoQueryF["PhotoQuery(uploadDate > 2022-01-01)"]
PhotoQueryF --> PhotoQuery`}
  />
</center>

The first node in the list represents the last query builder method that was invoked (`whereName(P.equals('Jeff'))`) and the last node in the list represents the first query builder method that was invoked (`queryPhotos`).

Walking the linked list to the end will get you to the root that starts the query.

Running each node in the list from the end back to the start will run the full query. In reality, however, we convert the query to a `plan` and optimize the `plan` before running it. See [Query Planning](./2022-05-26-query-planning).

In reality, the above structure is actually a bit more complicated but this is the basic idea.

A more faithful representation of what is created by the query builder API in reality is reproduced below.

<center>
  <Mermaid
    id="two"
    chart={`graph TD
UserQueryF["UserQuery(name == Jeff)"] --> UserQuery
UserQuery --> HopQueryPtoU["HopQuery(PhotosToUsersEdge)"]
HopQueryPtoU --> PhotoQueryF["PhotoQuery(uploadDate > 2022-01-01)"]
PhotoQueryF --> PhotoQuery
PhotoQuery --> HopQueryUtoP["HopQuery(UsersToPhotosEdge)"]
HopQueryUtoP --> Root["Root(user)"]`}
  />
</center>

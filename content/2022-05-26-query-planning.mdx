# Review

Previously we discussed the [query builder](./2022-05-26-query-builder).

To recap, when a user interacts with the query builder a linked list of queries is built up behind the scenes. This list of queries holds a reference to the prior query and an expression to apply. Wehn taking this list together as a whole, it represents the user's desired final query.

E.g., invoking the query builder like this

```typescript
const jeffQuery = user
  .queryPhotos()
  .whereUploadDate(P.greaterThan(new Date('2022-01-01')))
  .queryTaggedUsers()
  .whereName(P.equals('Jeff'));
```

returns a linked list that looks roughly like

<center>
  <Mermaid
    id="one"
    chart={`graph LR
UserQueryF["UserQuery(name == Jeff)"] --> UserQuery
UserQuery --> PhotoQueryF["PhotoQuery(uploadDate > 2022-01-01)"]
PhotoQueryF --> PhotoQuery`}
  />
</center>

The first node in the list represents the last query builder method that was invoked (`whereName(P.equals('Jeff'))`) and the last node in the list the first query builder method (`queryPhotos`).

# Planning

There are several important steps that happen after building a query to get it into a state where it can be executed. The first of those is the query planning step.

The core idea of query planning is to walk the list of expressions and pull out (hoist) as many expressions as possible to send them to be executed directly in the database. Expressions that cannot be hoisted will be executed within the application via the [chunk iterable framework](./2022-05-26-chunk-iterable) (chunked iteration phase to be covered in more detail in a future post).

## The Walk

We walk the list of queries provided by our query builder, collecting the expressions it contains into one or more plans.

We perform this walk by asking the last query returned by the query builder to plan itself. It then asks the query before it to plan itself and so on, all the way to the beginning.

The "root" or "source" plan is then returned back up the stack at which point each query appends its expressions to the plan.

```typescript
abstract class DerivedQuery {

  ...

  plan() {
    const plan = this.priorQuery.plan();
    if (this.expression) {
      plan.addDerivation(this.expression);
    }

    return plan;
  }
}

abstract class SourceQuery {
  plan() {
    return new Plan(this.expression. [])
  }
}
```

Lets start with a simple query. Finding all users name "Bill".

```javascript
const query = user.queryAll().whereName(P.equals('Bill'));
```

Which generates a linked list that looks like:

<center>
  <Mermaid
    id="twp"
    chart={`graph LR
UserQueryF["UserQuery(name == Bill)"] --> UserQuery
UserQuery --> SQLSourceQuery
`}
  />
</center>

`UserQuery(name == Bill)` being the "last" node in the list and linked back to prior queries.

Planning this query would convert it from this list of queries to a source expression and list of derived expressions.

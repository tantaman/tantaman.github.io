So you want to deploy a site that uses `MDX`? Outside of using [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx), this process is much more difficult than it aught to be.

Technically we don't even need to mess with `mdx-bundler` (see [Building Without Bundling](./2022-05-12-skipping-the-bundling)). Going the "bundle-free" route, we can drop down and use [`@mdx-js/mdx`](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) directly. To me, bundle-free makes sense for `MDX` given each `MDX` page will likely be a small scale project.

> It will be interesting to see the days where we're developing entirely within documents and interlinking dozens or hundreds of docs via their exports. Where the prose is the first class citizen and the code the second. The confluence of [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)/[ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/)/[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)/[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)/[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)/[CraftDocs](https://www.craft.do/)/[Coda](https://coda.io/)/[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)/[Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/) like features being brought together into a single authoring and coding paltform.

## Getting Started

To use `@mdx-js/mdx` directly we'll go over a few things:

1. Ingesting MDX content for processing
2. Deciding what transformations to apply
3. Applying transforms and compiling the MDX to JavaScript
4. Supplying JSX & using the component on the frontend

### Ingesting Content

First step is to ingest your content. These can be files from disk or some other source of `MDX` content.

If they're files on disk you can read them easily via the `fs` api in `Node`/`Deno`.

```javascript
import { read } from 'to-vfile';

const files = await fs.promises.readdir(path);
await Promise.all(files.map(async (file) => processMdx(await read(file))));
```

[`to-vfile`](https://github.com/vfile/to-vfile) is a package that converts a file to [Unifiedjs](https://unifiedjs.com/)'s virtual file format for text processing. If you're reading files from the filesystem, its important to do this conversion to a vfile as some transformations rely on the metadata this conversion will bring (e.g., [unified-infer-git-meta](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified-infer-git-meta)).

We'll fill in the details of `processMdx` when we cover compiling mdx to js.

### Picking Transformations

`MDX` is based on `Remark`, `Rehype` and the `Unifiedjs` ecosystem. This ecosystem is comprised of a large set of plugins or transformations that you can use to control the final output of your `MDX` conversion.

At a high level, plugins are chained together into a processing pipeline. The plugins that come first deal at the lowest level of abstract, enriching or transforming the data to higher levels of abstraction before passing it on to the next set of plugins in the chain (for more on pipelines in general, see [inheritance, aggregation and pipelines](/2013-07-30-Inheritance-Aggregation-and-Pipelines.html#pipelines)).

> Nit: At the lowest levels (e.g., parsing and tokenizing) extensions will be combined or invoked in turn without passing data to one another. At higher levels (rehype and above) each plugin does manipulate the `AST` and pass on its results to the next plugin.

All of the various plugins that are available to you to enrich your transformation of `MDX` (or `MD` or just text in general) can [be found here](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/).

Figuring out what to use may seem daunting so here are a few common packages.

1. [remark-parse](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-parse) - to parse markdown. Already included by `@mdx-js/mdx`.
2. [remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter) - to extract frontmatter
3. [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) - to support github flavored markdown
4. [remark-wiki-link](https://github.com/landakram/remark-wiki-link) - to enable wiki link syntax
5. [remark-rehype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype) - to convert the markdown ast to an html ast for futher processing. Already included by `@mdx-js/mdx`.
6. [rehype-highlight](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight) - to eanble code highlighting

### Applying Transformations

Applying transformations is as simple as passing their imported modules and options to `compile` from `@mdx-js/mdx`. To do that, we'll go ahead an implement the `processMdx` function that we called earlier.

```javascript
import { compile } from '@mdx-js/mdx';
import remarkFrontmatter from 'remark-frontmatter';
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm';
import remarkWikiLink from 'remark-wiki-link';
import rehypeInferDescriptionMeta from 'rehype-infer-description-meta';
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings';
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight';

async function processMdx(file) {
  return await compile(file, {
    remarkPlugins: [
      remarkFrontmatter,
      () => (tree, file) => {
        matter(file, { strip: true });
      },
      remarkGfm,
      remarkWikiLink,
    ],
    rehypePlugins: [
      [rehypeInferDescriptionMeta, { truncateSize: 255 }],
      rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
      rehypeHighlight,
    ],
  }).toString();
}
```

### Supplying JSX & Using the Component

What `processMdx` will do is to return a JavaScript module that defines a React component that represents the MDX document. What is not included in the genreated component, however, is the code for any imports you may require.

One way of including React without bundling it directly with the `MDX` component (or requiring another build step after generating the component) is to supply the `jsxImportSource` option.

```javascript
async function processMdx(file) {
  return await compile(file, {
    jsxImportSource: 'https://esm.sh/react',
    ...
  });
}
```

Any imports referenced within your component either need to be URLs that resolve to ES Modules -or- imports that can be resolved in a later build step.

If you need to bundle your dependencies along with the MDX component in this phase, see [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler). `mdx-bundler` works much the same as what we've describe here except it'll use `ESBuild` to scan imports and bundle their code in with the final component. We've taken a non-bundling approach (as described [here](http://localhost:3000/2022-05-12-skipping-the-bundling)) for this article.

Now how do you

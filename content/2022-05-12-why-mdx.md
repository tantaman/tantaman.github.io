**Why does `MDX` exist? Why do we need it?**

First, `Markdown` and `MDX` invert our relationship with markup languages. They put the prose, the content, first and the markup second.

Second, they're a format that can be written by a human being. The shortcuts they provide has even become a shorthand to applying styles in rich text editors (e.g., google docs, quip, apple notes) without having to click around.

But still, are these reasons enough to justify their existence? There's something more to it.

Markdown lays bare its file format to the end user. The user of markdown is almost as well versed in its file format as the programs that are meant to read it.

The fact that a file format has been laid bare to users and taken off is a peculiar turn of events.

How'd this happen? Why'd this happen? Is it only something that exists in the realm of developers?

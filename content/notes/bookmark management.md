I've got a directory for bookmarks. I don't think I need it.

I think I just need a directory for notes and a second process that pull all external links referenced by notes out. That list is my bookmarks. No need to keep an indcidentally organized list of things in bookmarks. Incidental in that they're organized by.. URL? rather than content and context which is how notes are organized.

Same for a "journal" -- a journal should just be constructed by taking all of my edits to all of my notes for that day and putting them into a timeline.

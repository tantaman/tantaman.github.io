Bookmarks are in files based on domain.
A single file may have multiple bookmars.

Bookmarks are wikilinked to other relevant bookmars or notes.

Our `index` page of bookmarks should thus sufrace:
1. Titles of all bookmarks in a file
2. Other notes/bookmarks (files) referenced by the bookmark

We may link to pages that do not exist yet. We should implement a 404 handler that renders all backlinks to the non-existing page.

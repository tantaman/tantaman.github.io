After ~8 years working at Meta and ~15 years professionally programming post college, I'm departing the workforce to puruse my own ideas full time.

## Vision 1

> **Create software to help people think more deeply.**

### Strategy

Two prongs:

1. Develop note taking applications to allow individuals to capture, structure and develop their thoughts. Notes are not strictly text.
2. Uplevel programming languages by extricating them from incidental details.

### Why two prongs?

To converge organic knowledge capture with formal methods of encoding throught processes.

## Vision 2

> **Make p2p & e2ee software as simple to develop as traditional client/server software.**

### Why?

Dissolve central power and control to:

1. Make the web censorship proof
2. Destroy winner take all markets
3. Elevate pay by increasing competition in every digital market
4. Eliminate central gate-keepers

### Strategy

Develop [Aphrodite](https://github.com/tantaman/aphrodite) with p2p, e2ee, p2p privacy (e.g., privacy respecting p2p replication of data), data consitency capabilities.

## Vision 3

> **Software developed for the Government (by or for) is public software and thus should be open source.**

### Why?

Cost reduction. Maintenance. More transparent governance.

### Strategy

Lead by example. Acquire contracts and develop the solutions as open source software.

## Vision 4

> **Buy an island and start my own nation.**

<nav class="toc"><ol class="toc-level toc-level-1"></ol></nav><p>From time to time I run across people decrying the current state of web development with words like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've gone completely backwards! We've gone from separating our structure, style and logic to putting them all into the same file! inline styles! inline html! inline event handlers! NOOOOO!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentiment misses the point.</p>
<p>In the past, we didn't have a good component model for the web. Not being able to split stuff into components, developers ended up splitting on <strong>incidental boundaries</strong>. They ended up splitting on Structure (<code>HTML</code>), Style (<code>CSS</code>) &#x26; Logic (<code>JS</code>). This reduced complexity by a factor of 3 but you still had a problem. All of your <strong>components</strong> were still <strong>bundled together</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>All of their structures were mixed together in the same HTML.</li>
<li>All their styles were mixed together in the same CSS.</li>
<li>All their logic was mixed together in a few JS files.</li>
</ol>
<p>As time went on, however, things got better.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>HTML</code> got templates and partials</li>
<li><code>CSS</code> got imports and pre-processors</li>
<li><code>JS</code> got real imports. First with things like requirejs/commonjs/amd, later with ES6</li>
</ol>
<p>These advancements allowed the untangling components and we hit a brief phase where component definitions would have a bunch of tiny files:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-diff"><span class="hljs-deletion">- likeButton.js</span>
<span class="hljs-deletion">- likeButton.html</span>
<span class="hljs-deletion">- likeButton.css</span>
</code></pre>
<p>each with a few lines of code and referencing data from one another.</p>
<p>This atomization of components didn't make sense so developers made the reasonable choice of bundling <code>html</code>, <code>css</code>, &#x26; <code>js</code> all back together again. Except, this time, <strong>it was different</strong>. This time we only bundled the <code>html</code>, <code>css</code> &#x26; <code>js</code> of a <em>single component</em> together.</p>
<p>Have we gone back to the days of combined &#x26; inline <code>html</code>, <code>css</code> &#x26; <code>js</code>? Yes, but not in the way you think.</p>
<p><strong>We now split our code where it matters</strong> -- at the component level.</p>

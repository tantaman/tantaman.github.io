<p>The quest to finding a general principle which can define these words is always admirable and bears much fruit (e.g., reading Heidegger's work on coming up with a the nature and definition of "being" is continually mind expanding) but I think words of the class of art
actually don't have proper conceptual definitions. They are defined by a set of concretes rather than an abstract principle. They are non-conceptual words.</p>
<p>Taking art as an example.</p>
<p>What is art?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is what an athlete does art?</li>
<li>Is how you live your life a work of art?</li>
<li>Is everything hanging in a museum art?</li>
<li>Is anything that anyone creates (even a todo list) art?</li>
<li>Is art that which reflects one's sense of life and how they believe things ought to be?</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone picked any of those definitions for "art" then it is likely to only be held by them and a few other like-minded individuals. Making conversing about art impossible as those they converse with will have different definitions.</p>
<p>Maybe art is really just all of the things a culture has chosen to uphold as art at a given point in time. I.e., art is enumarted by the concretes of the moment rather than having a conceptual unity.</p>
<p>Is this way of defining terms a dangerous way of thinking that ceases thoughtfulness? Probably.</p>

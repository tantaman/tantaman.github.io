<p>Objects are a poor man’s closures. Closures are a poor man’s objects.</p>

<p>Some people say everything is an object. I used to too but these days I think everything is actually a function.</p>
<ol>
<li>A map? Isn’t that just a function that maps from one value to another?</li>
<li>An array? Well that can be thought of as a map which can be thought of as a function.</li>
<li>An object? Those are just partial functions that return functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lets take a closer look. Here is a <strong>pair implemented as a function</strong>. It is implemented in Javascript for illustration purposes.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-sql">var pairCreator <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">first</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">second</span>) {
  var <span class="hljs-keyword">first</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">second</span>;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(which) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> which <span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span> ? <span class="hljs-keyword">first</span> : <span class="hljs-keyword">second</span>;
  }
}
var pair <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> pairCreator(<span class="hljs-string">'hello'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'there'</span>);
console.<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(pair(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>) <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> <span class="hljs-string">' '</span> <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> pair(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>));
</code></pre>
<p>How do we implement an <strong>object as a function</strong>? Well it is pretty similar to the pair example.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MyObjConstructor</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">greeting</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> greet = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(greeting);
  }
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> leave = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    ...
  }
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">method</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">switch</span>(method) {
      <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-string">'greet'</span>:
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> greet;
      <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-string">'leave'</span>:
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> leave;
    }
  }
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = <span class="hljs-title class_">MyObjConstructor</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"hello there"</span>);
<span class="hljs-title function_">obj</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'greet'</span>)(); <span class="hljs-comment">// call the greet method</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> leave = <span class="hljs-title function_">obj</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'leave'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// save a pointer to the leave method</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Of course you wouldn’t ever really want to implement an object like that in Javascript ;)</p>
<p>It is an interesting thought experiment to try to look at everything as a function. It’ll get you to design your software in new ways and to find entirely new applications for closures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The venerable master Qc Na was walking with his student, Anton. Hoping to prompt the master into a discussion, Anton said** “Master, I have heard that objects are a very good thing — is this true?”** Qc Na looked pityingly at his student and replied, <strong>“Foolish pupil — objects are merely a poor man’s closures.”</strong></p>
<p>Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his cell, intent on studying closures. He carefully read the entire “Lambda: The Ultimate…” series of papers and its cousins, and implemented a small Scheme interpreter with a closure-based object system. He learned much, and looked forward to informing his master of his progress.</p>
<p>On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by saying <strong>“Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now understand that objects are truly a poor man’s closures.”</strong> Qc Na responded by hitting Anton with his stick, saying <strong>“When will you learn? Closures are a poor man’s object.”</strong> At that moment, Anton became enlightened.</p>

<p>So why <code>SQLite</code>? And why now?</p>
<p>For me, its about re-architecting how we write code so it can fit the coming world of edge, dstributed and local-first computing.</p>
<p>In one way, <code>sqlite</code> is a great fit for distributed applications given it can be embedded directly into devices at the dge.</p>
<p>In another way, it is an awful choice because it doesn't have a sync protocol nor does it support eventual consistency.</p>
<p>So is it great or is it awful? Let's take a little journey through a few stops to see how all this plays out and why I'm bullish on <code>sqlite</code>.</p>

<p>The relational model has <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf">stood the test of time</a> and proven itself to be one of the best choices you can make for managing the data backing your application(s). Maybe you could even say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_predator">it is an apex predator</a>.</p>
<p>That being said, relational databases are firmly on the CA side of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP</a>. In the face of a network partition, they sacrafice all availability.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if we could use our relational databases even in cases of prolonged network partitions?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tantaman/conflict-free-sqlite">With a few tweaks</a> we can add an eventually consistent layer, atop relational databases, that can stay available in the face of network partitions. This means</p>
<ul>
<li>We can suddenly use <code>sqlite</code> for peer to peer applications.</li>
<li>That we can have a multi-master relationship between our server and client.</li>
<li>We can allow clients to make arbitrary changes to their local database and merge changes to, or from, the server (or other peers) at some arbitrary point in time in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>This is very appealing for any situation where you want to allow the user to interact with their data without waiting for a response from the server and to be able to sync their data between all devices they use. That this can be built atop existing technologies and existing storage solutions, rather than requiring something new, is an added bonus.</p>
<p>All of these benefits rely on eventual consistency. This begs the question of what data consistency needs your data actually has.</p>
<h1 id="respecting-the-consistency-needs-of-the-data"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#respecting-the-consistency-needs-of-the-data"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Respecting the Consistency Needs of the Data</h1>
<p><img src="./blog-assets/why-sqlite/respect.jpeg" alt="respect"></p>
<p>The lack of options, aside from stong consistency, in relational databases has locked us into not thinking about what level of data consistency we actually need. As such, in traditional web applications all changes go through a central service and are generally strongly consistent. In this realtional + client-server paradigm, we don't even reach for eventual consistency until we run into performance, availability or scaling problems.</p>
<p>This has blinded us to the fact that large swaths of state do not ever need to go through a central server or need strong consistency.</p>
<p>User registration and bank transfers certainly do need strong consistency -- you don't want two users claiming the same handle or double spending but do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborative documents (e.g., google docs)?</li>
<li>Upvotes on posts?</li>
<li>Tweeting?</li>
<li>Adding an item to a shopping cart?</li>
</ul>
<p>These all just need to be eventually consistent.</p>
<p>By unlocking eventually consistent options atop the relational model, we give developers the ability to model all of their data in a familiar way and with the consistency options that make sense rather than just those that are at hand.</p>
<p>The pripr lack of options has put us down a path of default strong consistency and centralized client-server architecture that is</p>
<ul>
<li>Expensive</li>
<li>Complex</li>
<li>Incompatible with distributed and edge computing</li>
<li>Has hard speed limits</li>
<li>Precludes self-custody of data</li>
</ul>
<p>This is being revealed in ever more painful detail today as we try to fit the square peg of strong consistency &#x26; client-server models into the round hole that is distributed &#x26; edge computing in an attempt to overcome the speed of light.</p>
<h1 id="breaking-the-speed-of-light"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#breaking-the-speed-of-light"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Breaking the Speed of Light</h1>
<p><img src="./blog-assets/why-sqlite/light.jpeg" alt="light"></p>
<p>For applications that require a server for a large percentage of their interactions (e.g., to ensure strong consistency of writes), the speed of light becomes quite problematic.</p>
<p>Checking our <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math">napkin math</a> we can see that</p>
<ul>
<li>NA East &#x3C;-> West takes <strong>60ms</strong></li>
<li>EU West &#x3C;-> NA East takes <strong>80ms</strong></li>
<li>NA West &#x3C;-> Singapore takes <strong>180ms</strong></li>
<li>EU West &#x3C;-> Singapore takes <strong>160ms</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>two sequential round trips from <code>NA West</code> to <code>Singapore</code> will get you close to half a second of delay.</p>
<p>In the "strongly consistent, client-server paradigm" (from now on called "the paradigm"), the path of resolving this roughly goes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bundle resources (js, css, html, etc.)</li>
<li>Add a CDN</li>
<li>Add application servers in more regions</li>
<li>Do server side rendering</li>
<li>Add read replicas of the database to new regions</li>
<li>Add optimistic writes to the application</li>
<li>Shard the database, putting masters of given replicasets closer to certain users</li>
<li>Put some low-value code into edge functions</li>
<li>?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a lot of work and a lot of moving parts just to shorten the length of and reduce the number of round trips. In other words, a lot of work solving incidental rather than essential complexity. Yeah, the work delivers business value by making your app faster but the work isn't tied to the business's core mission or competency.</p>
<p>My 8th statement might raise some eyebrows. "Low value code." I say this because the example use cases for edge functions <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/edge-functions-explained/#example-edge-functions-use-cases">certainly aren't very compelling</a>.</p>
<p>Sure you can throw all of your business logic into the edge but that probably won't behave as you expect (to be seen later).</p>
<p>The complexity of scaling "the paradigm" and the lack of compelling edge compute use cases for apps architected under "the paradigm" points to the fact that we've hit the limits of "the paradigm." "The paradigm" isn't ready for and was never made for edge computing.</p>
<h1 id="turning-edge-architecture-upside-down-"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#turning-edge-architecture-upside-down-"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Turning Edge Architecture Upside Down üôÉ</h1>
<p>As we've seen, the fundamental goal of edge computing is to increase the speed of applications by moving compute &#x26; state closer to users. Similar to a CDN but also drastically <strong>not</strong> similar <strong>at all</strong> to a CDN. Moving compute and state is just not the same problem as moving static resources and caching responses.</p>
<p>E.g., if you deploy data-reliant application logic to <em>Singapore</em> but leave your database in <em>Ohio</em> you're probably going to have a really bad time. Those <code>Sing. -> Ohio</code> round trips for each DB call will be way worse than the single <code>user -> Ohio</code> round trip that you would have had previously had you kept the application colocated with the database. Static resources and cached data don't have behavior so placing copies of them everywhere only has upside.</p>
<p>Current edge architectures, being beholden to "the paradigm", are an attempt to solve new problems by applying old patterns.</p>
<p>What if we flipped everything on its head?</p>
<p><img src="./blog-assets/why-sqlite/blue-idea.jpg" alt="blue-idea"></p>
<p>What if, instead of always assuming that the server is the authortative source, we assumed that the user's local device is the authoritative source of information?</p>
<h2 id="local-first-paradigm"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#local-first-paradigm"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Local-First Paradigm</h2>
<p>In this world, all requests for state are immediately resolved on-device. The default deployment surface for compute (logic, code) is also on-device.</p>
<p>In the local-first paradigm, the default consistency mode is eventual consistency. This means that state and compute can naturally exist at the edge and are only brought to the "center" when there is a need for strong consistency.</p>
<p>In other words, the common case is edge computing. The specialized case is centralized computing.</p>
<p>If you want your app to be edge native, you need to switch paradigms.</p>
<p><code>sqlite</code> is a great fit for all of this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers are familiar with SQL</li>
<li>SQL has stood the test of time (<a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf">50+ years</a>)</li>
<li>SQL has massive adoption and many tools exist to interact with SQL from application code</li>
<li><code>sqlite</code> can be embedded directly into your application</li>
<li><code>sqlite</code> can be deployed anywhere your application is deployed</li>
<li><code>sqlite</code>, or any relational database, can be extended to support eventual consistency (proof of concept at <a href="https://github.com/tantaman/conflict-free-sqlite">conflict free sqlite</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="misc"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#misc"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Misc</h1>
<p>The local-first architecutre + embedding a database directly into your app has a number of other benefits on top of those we've already seen --</p>
<ul>
<li>Simpler</li>
<li>Reduced cloud costs</li>
<li>Self custody of data</li>
<li>Transaction support for mutation of application state</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="simpler-architecture"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#simpler-architecture"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Simpler Architecture</h2>
<p><img src="./blog-assets/why-sqlite/Hugh-Jackman-in-The-Fountain.jpeg" alt="simpler"></p>
<p>When you can treat your local data store as an authoritative source of information, this enables abstracting away a large swath of complexity.</p>
<p>You read and write directly to your local data layer and it is your local data layer that manages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Syncing changes back to a server or other peers</li>
<li>Receiving updates from a server or peers</li>
<li>Notifying the application that new data is available</li>
</ol>
<p>Since all reads and writes are local, you're no longer worried about network latency.</p>
<p>Since your local data store is an authoritative source of information, you're not worried about cache invalidation.</p>
<p>Of course there are tradeoffs. The most obvious is data consistency. This only works for data that either never needs to be reconciled with peers or for data that can be eventually consistent / modeled as a <a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDT</a>. Others conerns are --</p>
<ol>
<li>How much data can you store locally?</li>
<li>How do you signal to the user that their local set of data could be incomplete from the perspective of other peers?</li>
<li>How do we bless certain peers (or servers) as authoritative sources of certain sets of information?</li>
<li>What CRDTs are right for which use cases?</li>
</ol>
<p>These questions are being explored by myself and various working groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://braid.org/">https://braid.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/">https://www.inkandswitch.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aphrodite.sh/">https://aphrodite.sh/</a> (self)</li>

<li><a href="https://riffle.systems/">https://riffle.systems/</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lower-cloud-costs"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#lower-cloud-costs"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Lower Cloud Costs</h2>
<p>Since compute and storage is moved as much to the user's device as possible, you're no longer footing the bill for every CPU cycle they run and every bit they need to transfer and store.</p>
<h2 id="data-custody"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#data-custody"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Data Custody</h2>
<p>The user's device is an authoritative set of information. It no longer needs to ship every mutation off to a central service before that mutation is accepted. The user can be given <em>control</em> of what leaves their device and their application(s) will still function.</p>
<h2 id="transaction-support"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#transaction-support"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Transaction Support</h2>
<p><img src="./blog-assets/why-sqlite/Oscar-can2.webp" alt="oscar"></p>
<p>This is an entirely new point of departure from what has been discussed so far. We've mainly dealt with the distribution of state and flipping the model from "default strong consistency, default client-server" to "default eventual consistency, default distributed."</p>
<p>Given that, I'll keep it brief.</p>
<p>In short, applications are plagued by state management problems. Global state, within a program, is always seen as our enemy. More or less as a dumpster fire. But... a database is giant pile of global state that is being read and written by many different applications.</p>
<p>Why do we have so few problems with the global and mutable state that is the database but so many problems with global and/or mutable state that exist in-memory?</p>
<p>It comes down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The primitives we have to express mutations</li>
<li>Support for transactions against in-memory data structures</li>
<li>Support for constraints on im-memory data</li>
</ul>
<p>If our programming languages had support for ACID transactions against in-memory data then entire classes of problems related to mutable state (in particular, those of observing partial states) would vanish.</p>
<p>We can, in some ways, use an embedded in-memory <code>sqlite</code> as a hack to gain this power for our application state.</p>
<h1 id="sql-drawbacks"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#sql-drawbacks"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>SQL Drawbacks</h1>
<p>Another set of ideas for another time but --</p>
<p>One of the key strengths of the relational model is the ability to enter your data from any point. For a blogging app, to find <em>any</em> or <em>all</em> comments you can query the comment table. To find <em>any</em> or <em>all</em> users you can query the user table. The relational model does not rely on access paths.</p>
<p>Compare this with many <code>NoSQL</code> models which often structure their data into trees. Access path suddenly matters. To find <em>any</em> comment you need to know what post it is attached to. To find <em>all</em> comments, you must know that you have to traverse all posts to all comments. If architecture changes and someone changes the branch structure, you have to go update all your application logic to use the new paths.</p>
<p>In this latter way, supposedly schema-less <code>NoSQL</code> has more requirements than SQL. NoSQL requires you to understand how your data is layed out (access path) when retrieving arbitrary data. Relational/SQL does not since all types are flattened / normalized into their own tables.</p>
<p>There are more revelatory observations like this in the <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf">original relational databases paper</a> from 1970.</p>
<p>My addition, however, is that once we <em>do</em> have a start node (a comment, post, user, etc.), a <code>Graph</code> query language is a better fit for application queries than <code>SQL</code>.</p>
<p>This is the case since once you <em>do</em> have a start node, the relationships <em>on</em> that start node are properties <em>of</em> the data and the majority of queries made by the application are traversals <em>from</em> that start node. Finding start nodes is what SQL explicitly excels at. (note to self: future post on sharding and resurgence of graph models for sharded sql dbs (and why they're required here) then resurgence, again, of relational for the data warehouse).</p>
<p>Once you <em>do</em> have a post to start from, instead of doing:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">select</span> comment.<span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> post <span class="hljs-keyword">join</span> comment <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> comment.post_id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> post.id <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span> post.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> comment.date <span class="hljs-operator">&#x3C;</span> cursor.date <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> comment.id <span class="hljs-operator">&#x3C;</span> cursor.id <span class="hljs-keyword">order</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">by</span> <span class="hljs-type">date</span>, id <span class="hljs-keyword">desc</span> limit <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
</code></pre>
<p>to get it's comments, we traverse like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-js">post.<span class="hljs-title function_">comments</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">last</span>(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">after</span>(curosr);
</code></pre>
<p>An idea being explored in <a href="https://aphrodite.sh/">Aphrodite</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: traversals / access paths, after having a start node, are a property of the data rather than a property of how we store it. The former being what relational models preserve, the latter being what NoSQL models expose.</p>

<nav class="toc"><ol class="toc-level toc-level-1"></ol></nav><p>Today I'll be discussing the <a href="https://github.com/tantaman/aphrodite/blob/main/packages/query-runtime-ts/src/ChunkIterable.ts"><code>Chunk Iterable Framework</code></a>. This is a core component of <a href="http://aphrodite.sh">Aphrodite</a> and is used to speed up the processing of data returned by queries.</p>
<p>The main idea behind a chunk iterable is to be able to iterate over some source of data in chunks. Why would we want to iterate over a data source in chunks?</p>
<p>Mainly for performance. Imagine you have an unbounded stream of data. There are two options for processing this data that exist on a spectrum.</p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1: Process everything in the stream all at once.</li>
<li>Option 2: Process a single item from the stream at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the source is unbounded (or larger than your working memory), Option 1 is not possible.</p>
<p>Option 2 is always possible but can be slow. Option 2 is like making 10,000 individual trips to the store to pick up 10,000 packs of m&#x26;ms. You probably can't fit 10,000 packs of m&#x26;ms in a single tripe but you could get a chunk of 500 packs in a single trip, reducing your total trips from 10,000 to 20.</p>
<p><code>ChunkIterable</code> is the same. If a data source could return a massive amount of data, <code>ChunkIterable</code> streams the results back in chunks. This strikes a nice balance between batch processing and not overwhelming your local resources.</p>
<p><code>ChunkIterable</code>, conforming to an <code>Iterable</code> interface, also allows you to perform operations like <code>filter</code> &#x26; <code>map</code> against chunks.</p>
<p>This is important for <code>Aphrodite</code> as <code>Aphrodite</code> uses <code>map</code> to turn a raw data stream into models and uses <code>filter</code> to apply filters to streams that couldn't be hoisted to the database layer.</p>

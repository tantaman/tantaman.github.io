<nav class="toc"><ol class="toc-level toc-level-1"></ol></nav><p>"A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing"</p>
<p>How do yo interpret that?</p>
<ul>
<li>Does that mean knowledge is power and even with a little bit one can become a dangerous advesary?</li>
<li>Or does it mean if you only know a little, rather than a lot, you are putting yourself in great peril?</li>
</ul>
<p>People understand that power tools, electrical sockets, gas stoves, fast moving water, etc. need to be treated with respect and handling them requires doing so within a specific framework that will maintain one's safety. Why do people not also understand that the same is true in relation to beliefs, ideas, disciplines, ways of thinking?</p>

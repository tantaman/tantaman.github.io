# Leaving Meta

Unlike [leaving Lockheed](/career/lockheed/leaving), leaving [Meta](meta.com) was an altogether different experience.

At [Meta](meta.com) I had the chance to work with the best of the best and show that I could stand with them and even be at the top amongst them.
It sucks that human beings require validation but we do and I had finally gotten the validation I needed as an engineer.

I had the opportunity to work on real world problems, see and develop cutting edge technology that is [[being adopted by the mainstream]] (e.g., the mono-repo movement, React, JSX, GraphQL, [and more](https://opensource.fb.com/projects), with more still to be open sourced)
and improve the safety and privacy of billions of people around the world.

So why'd I decide to leave?

After having a kid I imagined conversations with him about how one should live their life. I realized that I wouldn't be able to be honest with him if he asked if I had
lived my life the way I wanted to. I'd never stepped out and taken a chance on my own ideas.

So that's what I'm doing and why I'm leaving. I'm betting on myself. Building things I've always wanted to see in the world and learning the things I've always had the urge to know.

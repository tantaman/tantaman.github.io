# Leaving Lockheed Martin

From 2008 - 2014 I worked at [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/). I took the job as a [[path of least resistance]].

Path of least resistance in that I was deathly shy at this time to the prospect of interviewing again at different companies was a non-starter.

While I took the job at Lockheed, I thought Lockheed was beneath me. In my mind Lockheed wasn't a _real_ software company.

This belief that Lockheed wasn't a real software company and that I had to test my skills against the best in the industry
persisted during my entire time there. It finally reached a [[breaking point]] where I had to leave and go somewhere else.
Every day I didn't leave made me feel like I was slowly dieing.

So in 2014 I interviewd with a [health startup](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/audax-health-solutions), [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) and [Facebook](meta.com).

All this being said, there we certainly many good parts of working at Lockheed. And, in retrospect, Lockheed had many
phenomnial engineers. Some of whom later joined me at [Facebook](https://about.facebook.com/).

The bad parts, however, were that there was no path for senior IC growth, management was extremely non-technical,
and iteration was very slow. Compensation was also 10x less than what I ended up earning at Facebook after ~2 years there.

# Who is this person here?

A man, a dude, a father, a husband, a lover of movies, tech, nature and those who use words recklessly.

## Previously & Professionally

I've spent most of the last decade building platforms to unearth the dark corners of social media and
to better protect new products developed in that space @ [Meta](meta.com). This work is known publicly as
"integrity" or ["trust and safety."](https://about.facebook.com/actions/promoting-safety-and-expression/).

While at [Meta](meta.com) I also led the move to privacy aware infrastructure for all of Integrity. This was the first time in
my career that imposter syndrome caused me to abdicate my techincal instincts and, while we made some impressive progress,
I view my efforts here as a failure when compared with what could have been. I'll write more on what "privacy aware infrastructure" is
as Meta makes more of those details public.

When I started at Meta it was a company of ~5,000 employees. When I left it was well over 100,000 employees. While still a great
place to work it isn't the company it once was.

## Currently

I'm researching and prototyping ways for individuals and organizations to better manage and grow their knowledge.
Some projects and people that inspire me in this space:

- [Gordon Brander](https://subconscious.substack.com/)
- [Craft Docs](https://www.craft.do/)
- [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Block Protocol](https://blockprotocol.org/)
- [Log Seq](https://logseq.com/)
- [Plain Text](https://plaintextaccounting.org/)
- [Geoffrey Litt](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/)
- [Take Smart Notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/)

This has a surprising amount of similarities with the work I did @ [Meta](meta.com) as trust and safety involves tracking decisions,
policies, curating knowledge about real world entities, linking that knowledge to virtual constructs, sharing that knowledge
across teams (when ready for publication) while also allowing private development of knowledge.

## Previously & Currently

I have a deep interest in schematization and making programming as declarative as possible.

1. If programming is more accessible (declarative) less custom apps need writing.
2. If our languages are declarative then machines can help us with what we _intend_ to do. It is a sad state of affairs that we spend
   all of our time telling a computer how to do something and little to no time telling it what we're doing. This is not only
   a loss for tooling but also a loss for documentation (in the sense of [code as documentation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeAsDocumentation.html)) and communicating
   between engineers.

In my career I applied schematization as a way to fix large swaths of problems. Both within integrity/trust & safety (see [[protocol-for-integrations]]) and
and privacy (see [[policy in code]] and [[data deletion]]).

## Weaknesses

As much as we embrace and explore success, [we should enjoy and explore our failures](https://www.philosophizethis.org/transcript/episode-156-transcript) ([audio](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/episode-152-the-frankfurt-school-walter-benjamin-pt-1-agcpw-fll9y)).
I'll write more on these as time goes by but my failings are the result of these weaknesses:

- Staying on teams and taking opportunities out of a sense of duty, obligation & chance for advancement rather than personal interest.
- Occasional imposter syndrome / placing too much confidence in the experience of others over my own experience.
- Being too hesitant to escalate problems to the director level and above.

## Strengths

I find it awkward to talk about stengths but, as uncomfortable as it may be, they must be stated so we can be aware of them
and be more effective.

- Ability to jump into any codebase and understand it quickly
- Ability to zoom out and predict the 2+ year investments to make
- Ability to zoom in and break that vision down into iterative chunks of execution
- Ability to communicate the broad ideas and small milestones to technical and non-technical partners
- Extermely fast developer from conception to design to implementation

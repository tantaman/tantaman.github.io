# Who is this person here?

A man, a dude, a father, a husband, a lover of movies, tech, nature and those who use words recklessly.

**Previously & Professionally**, I've spent the last decade building platforms to unearth the dark corners of social media and
to better protect new products developed in that space. This time was spent @ [Meta](meta.com). This work is known publicly as
"integrity" or ["trust and safety."](https://about.facebook.com/actions/promoting-safety-and-expression/)

**Currently**, I'm researching and prototyping ways for individuals and organizations to better manage and grow their knowledge.
Some projects and people that inspire me in this space:

- [Gordon Brander](https://subconscious.substack.com/)
- [Craft Docs](https://www.craft.do/)
- [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Block Protocol](https://blockprotocol.org/)
- [Log Seq](https://logseq.com/)
- [Plain Text](https://plaintextaccounting.org/)
- [Geoffrey Litt](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/)
- [Take Smart Notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/)

This has a surprising amount of similarities with the work I did @ [Meta](meta.com) as trust and safety involves tracking decisions,
policies, curating knowledge about real world entities, linking that knowledge to virtual constructs, sharing that knowledge
across teams (when ready for publication) while also allowing private development of knowledge.

**Currently & Previously** - I have a deep interest in schematization and making programming as declarative as possible.

This is hyperbole but I like to say:

> 99% of apps could just be spreadsheets.

and

> Code is a liability.

The meaning of the first is manifold. In one sense, the right abstraction can solve most of your problems. In another, [YAGNI](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html).

The last is to remind developers that while code does deliver value there is also a cost to every line that is written.
Maintenance cost, cost to the next developer who has to spend time reading it, eventually (at scale) even deployment costs. The last
one being a surprisingly high cost at Meta scale where we were well into the hundreds of millions of lines of code by the
time I departed the company.

Code is **obviously not always a liability**. If it were we'd never write it. Well tested and well abstracted code that never
needs to be inspected is nearly 100% value and 0% cost.

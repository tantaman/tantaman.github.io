# Who is this person here?

A man, a dude, a father, a husband, a lover of movies, tech, nature and those who use words recklessly.

## Previously & Professionally

I've spent the last decade building platforms to unearth the dark corners of social media and
to better protect new products developed in that space. This time was spent @ [Meta](meta.com). This work is known publicly as
"integrity" or ["trust and safety."](https://about.facebook.com/actions/promoting-safety-and-expression/)

## Currently

I'm researching and prototyping ways for individuals and organizations to better manage and grow their knowledge.
Some projects and people that inspire me in this space:

- [Gordon Brander](https://subconscious.substack.com/)
- [Craft Docs](https://www.craft.do/)
- [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Block Protocol](https://blockprotocol.org/)
- [Log Seq](https://logseq.com/)
- [Plain Text](https://plaintextaccounting.org/)
- [Geoffrey Litt](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/)
- [Take Smart Notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/)

This has a surprising amount of similarities with the work I did @ [Meta](meta.com) as trust and safety involves tracking decisions,
policies, curating knowledge about real world entities, linking that knowledge to virtual constructs, sharing that knowledge
across teams (when ready for publication) while also allowing private development of knowledge.

## Previously & Currently

I have a deep interest in schematization and making programming as declarative as possible.

1. If programming is more accessible (declarative) less custom apps need writing.
2. If our languages are declarative then machines can help us with what we _intend_ to do. It is a sad state of affairs that we spend
   all of our time telling a computer how to do something and little to no time telling it what we're doing. This is not only
   a loss for tooling but also a loss for documentation (in the sense of [code as documentation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeAsDocumentation.html)) and communicating
   between engineers.

In my career this manifested in several ways. See [[protocol-for-integrations]].

## Failures

- As much as we embrace and explore the beautiful [we must embrace failure](https://www.philosophizethis.org/transcript/episode-156-transcript)([audio](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/episode-152-the-frankfurt-school-walter-benjamin-pt-1-agcpw-fll9y)).

Why I left work...

-> Changing of the world and company. No more delights and curls.

Why write?

-> Is it waste of time or brings more clarity to what you're doing so you can do less / be more effective?
The hardest part is figuring out what you're building.. but still need pages of pages of calculation for the "in the dirt" work and intuition.

# TODO

- wikilinks. 2021-12-23-Deeply-Nested-Updates-React

- Change h1s to h2s in blog posts
- Change reactive markdown posts to normal mdx
- includes
- auto-tweet, macro blog -- https://alecmuffett.com/article/13253
- CSS.... all css includes are polluting a single stylesheet rather than existing once per blog.
  - Custom js stuff also doesn't work right when included into an mdx doc...
